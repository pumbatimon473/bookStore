Django REST Framework Assignment

Time Limit: 1 hour

Objective: Demonstrate your understanding of Django REST Framework by creating a simple API endpoint for a "Book" resource. The API should support basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).


Project Setup:

1. Create a new Django project (if you don't already have one):

django-admin startproject bookstore


2. Create a new Django app within the project:

cd bookstore
python manage.py startapp api

Tasks:

1. Models:

	- Create a Django model named Book with the following fields:
		○ title (CharField)
		○ author (CharField)
		○ genre (CharField)
		○ published_date (DateField)
		○ price (DecimalField)

2. Serializers:

	- Create a Django REST Framework serializer for the Book model that
includes all the fields.

3. Views:
	- Create a set of class-based views that inherit from
rest_framework.viewsets.ModelViewSet to handle the following actions:
		○ list (GET - Retrieve all books)
		○ retrieve (GET - Retrieve a single book by ID)
		○ create (POST - Create a new book)
		○ update (PUT - Update an existing book by ID)
		○ partial_update (PATCH - Partially update an existing book by ID)
		○ destroy (DELETE - Delete a book by ID)

4. URL Routing:
	- Define URL patterns in your app's urls.py to route requests to the
appropriate views. Use the Django REST Framework's router to
automatically generate the URLs for your viewset.

5. Bonus (If Time Permits):
	- Implement filtering (e.g., filter books by author or genre) and/or ordering
(e.g., order books by published date or price).


Submission:

Submit the following:
	- Your Django project code (including the models.py , serializers.py ,
views.py , and urls.py files).
	- Brief instructions on how to run your project locally.
